Agents are also called **Turtles**.

## The Fire Model

Phased transition: A small change in input parameter changed the output dramatically.

## The Traffic Model

With ABM, we can visual and characterize dynamic behavior of an agent which cannot be described by mean or average.

## The Tipping or The Segregation Model

Small change tips other agent to change their behavior.

> Note: ABM requires learning about existing models to build your own great model.
