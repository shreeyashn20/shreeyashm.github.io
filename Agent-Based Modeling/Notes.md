# Agent-Based Modeling - What and Why?

## What are model?

Model are abstract of real-world.

## What are ABM?

### Agent

Individual elements with properties

### ABM

interaction between agents and environment interactions

Agents are also called **Turtles**.

## The Fire Model

Phased transition: A small change in input parameter changed the output dramatically.

## The Traffic Model

With ABM, we can visual and characterize dynamic behavior of an agent which cannot be described by mean or average.

## The Tipping or The Segregation Model

Small change tips other agent to change their behavior.

> Note: ABM requires learning about existing models to build your own great model.

## The Social Network Model

OBABM.org and NetLogo website to refer models.

## The Spatial Model

Redfish Group

## Complex Systems, Emergence and Feedbacks

Complex Systems: Composed of emergence outcome and feedback interaction

Emergence: New phenomena - sum of all the parts

Feedback: effect of emergent

> Not a perfect prediction

## Representation

Why? Problem not solved before, New Questions, Better Results

Agents connected such that they are difficult to follow

## Third Way of Doing Science

Induction - Data to General theory

Deduction - First principles to General theory

Above is for Maths, Below for ABM

Generative - Generated data vs Real world data

This lead to integrative understand and differential understanding

## When to use ABM?

Medium Number - Too less number - game theory ; too many agents - statistics

Heterogeneity - Difference between agents; Game theory - Homogenous

Complex but Local Interaction - Interact differently
